**FietsTrack** is an innovative cycling tracking app, specially designed for the Apple Watch. It provides cyclists the ability to monitor their biking activities in real-time, connect with external heart rate monitors, and control their music on the go.

## Features 🌟

1. **External Heart Rate Monitor Support**: Via CoreBluetooth, it's possible to connect with an external heart rate monitor. If no external monitor is present, the built-in heart rate monitor of the Apple Watch is utilized.

2. **Activity Management**: Upon starting an activity, the user is presented with three windows:
    - **Control Window**: This allows the user to pause, restart, or stop the activity.
    - **Statistics Window**: Displays real-time stats like speed, heart rate, distance, and average values. Users can toggle between average and live values.
    - **Music Control**: Allows the user to control their music while on the move.

3. **Activity Summary**: After stopping an activity, a summary of all the statistics is shown.

4. **Activity History**: On the homepage, users can see a list of all their previous activities. By clicking on a specific activity, detailed information and the exact route of the activity is displayed.
